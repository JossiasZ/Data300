# Data 300
300 samples of data collected from the experimental setup.
300 samples of voltage (Voc/MaxVoc), current (Isc/MaxIsc), irradiance (G/1000) and temperature (AT/50) data were collected. In 100 samples, the system has not presented faults labeled as 0; in another 100, the system presented a partial shading fault labeled as 1; and in another 100, the system presented faults due to dirt accumulation labeled as 2.
# Data 60
60 samples of data collected from the real setup.
60 samples of voltage (Voc/MaxVoc), current (Isc/MaxIsc), irradiance (G/1000) and temperature (AT/50) data were collected. In 20 samples, the system has not presented faults labeled as 0; in another 20, the system presented a partial shading fault labeled as 1; and in another 20, the system presented faults due to dirt accumulation labeled as 2.
